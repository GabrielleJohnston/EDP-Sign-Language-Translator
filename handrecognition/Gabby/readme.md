### Instructions
Run the video processing programme on the DATABASE folders first. There are two different video processing programmes. Only run one of them. There is also an untested motion detection programme that can be run instead of the video processing programmes.

Make sure the 3d cnn file (i.e. keras model) is in the same folder as the numpy file created by the video processing, and then run it. 
"keras model.py" is the only 3D CNN currently uploaded, but a tflearn model will be uploaded.

### Required downloads (may not be up to date):
numpy: pip install numpy

tqdm: pip install tqdm

open CV: pip install cv2

os: pip install os

matplotlib: pip install matplotlib

tensorflow: pip install tensorflow=1.8

tflearn: pip install tflearn (not necessary if you use keras model)

keras: pip install keras (not necessary if you use tflearn model)

imutils: pip install imutils (for motion detection)

I think these should already be included in all versions of python, but if not:

math: pip install math

random: pip install random
