### Instructions
Run the video processing programme on the DATABASE/What and DATABASE/Hungry folders first.
Make sure the 3d cnn file is in the same folder as the numpy file created by the video processing, and then run it. 

I have added both python notebook and python file versions.

### Required downloads:
numpy: pip install numpy

tqdm: pip install tqdm

open CV: pip install cv2

os: pip install os

matplotlib: pip install matplotlib

tensorflow: pip install tensorflow=1.8

tflearn: pip install tflearn


I think these should already be included in all versions of python, but if not:
math: pip install math
random: pip install random
